services and attacks.
1.6 Draw a matrix similar to Table 1.4 that shows the relationship between security
mechanisms and attacks. 

Security Services (X.800)
AUTHENTICATION
The assurance that the communicating entity is the
one that it claims to be.
Peer Entity Authentication
Used in association with a logical connection to
provide confidence in the identity of the entities
connected.
Data-Origin Authentication
In a connectionless transfer, provides assurance that
the source of received data is as claimed.
ACCESS CONTROL
The prevention of unauthorized use of a resource
(i.e., this service controls who can have access to a
resource, under what conditions access can occur,
and what those accessing the resource are allowed
to do).
DATA CONFIDENTIALITY
The protection of data from unauthorized
disclosure.
Connection Confidentiality
The protection of all user data on a connection.
Connectionless Confidentiality
The protection of all user data in a single data block
Selective-Field Confidentiality
The confidentiality of selected fields within the user
data on a connection or in a single data block.
Traffic-Flow Confidentiality
The protection of the information that might be
derived from observation of traffic flows.
DATA INTEGRITY
The assurance that data received are exactly as
sent by an authorized entity (i.e., contain no
modification, insertion, deletion, or replay).
Connection Integrity with Recovery
Provides for the integrity of all user data on a
connection and detects any modification, insertion,
deletion, or replay of any data within an entire data
sequence, with recovery attempted.
Connection Integrity without Recovery
As above, but provides only detection without recovery.
Selective-Field Connection Integrity
Provides for the integrity of selected fields within the
user data of a data block transferred over a connec
tion and takes the form of determination of whether
the selected fields have been modified, inserted,
deleted, or replayed.
Connectionless Integrity
Provides for the integrity of a single connectionless
data block and may take the form of detection of
data modification. Additionally, a limited form of
replay detection may be provided.
Selective-Field Connectionless Integrity
Provides for the integrity of selected fields within a
single connectionless data block; takes the form of
determination of whether the selected fields have
been modified.
NONREPUDIATION
Provides protection against denial by one of the
entities involved in a communication of having
participated in all or part of the communication.
Nonrepudiation, Origin
Proof that the message was sent by the specified party.
Nonrepudiation, Destination
Proof that the message was received by the specified
party.


Security Mechanisms (X.800)
SPECIFIC SECURITY MECHANISMS
May be incorporated into the appropriate protocol
layer in order to provide some of the OSI security
services.
Encipherment
The use of mathematical algorithms to transform
data into a form that is not readily intelligible. The
transformation and subsequent recovery of the
data depend on an algorithm and zero or more
encryption keys.
Digital Signature
Data appended to, or a cryptographic transformation
of, a data unit that allows a recipient of the data unit
to prove the source and integrity of the data unit and
protect against forgery (e.g., by the recipient).
Access Control
A variety of mechanisms that enforce access rights to
resources.
Data Integrity
A variety of mechanisms used to assure the integrity
of a data unit or stream of data units.
PERVASIVE SECURITY MECHANISMS
Mechanisms that are not specific to any particular
OSI security service or protocol layer.
Trusted Functionality
That which is perceived to be correct with respect
to some criteria (e.g., as established by a security
policy).
Security Label
The marking bound to a resource (which may be a
data unit) that names or designates the security attri
butes of that resource.
Event Detection
Detection of security-relevant events.
Security Audit Trail
Data collected and potentially used to facilitate a
security audit, which is an independent review and
examination of system records and activities.
Security Recovery
Deals with requests from mechanisms, such as event
handling and management functions, and takes
recovery actions.

encipherment mechanism is simply an encryption algorithm that allows data to
be encrypted and subsequently decrypted. Irreversible encipherment mechanisms
include hash algorithms and message authentication codes, which are used in digital signature and message authentication applications.
Table 1.4, based on one in X.800, indicates the relationship between security
services and security mechanisms.
SPECIFIC SECURITY MECHANISMS
Authentication Exchange
A mechanism intended to ensure the identity of an
entity by means of information exchange.
Traffic Padding
The insertion of bits into gaps in a data stream to
frustrate traffic analysis attempts.
Routing Control
Enables selection of particular physically secure
routes for certain data and allows routing changes,
especially when a breach of security is suspected.
Notarization
The use of a trusted third party to assure certain
properties of a data exchange.

ATTACKS:
Release of message contents
Traffic analysis
Masquerade
Replay
Message Modification
Denial of Service
